SFaceCompare is a simple library for iOS to find and compare faces.
SFaceCompare works on top of dlib and OpenCV libraries. With usage of trained model.

## Features

- [x] Face detecting / extracting
- [x] Face aligment
- [x] Face matching

## Used Libraries

- [dlib](https://github.com/davisking/dlib) - Image processing
- [openCV](https://github.com/opencv/opencv) - Detecting face landmarks and face alignment

These libraries were used to create SameFace.framework which src on CVDlibUtils branch

## Example

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

## Installation
### Import Faces.mlmodel
Make import of Faces.mlmodel file into your actual project. To make this.
1) Open Example App provided with this repo
2) Find Faces.mlmodel
3) Drag/Copy-Paste into root of your project
### CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```
> CocoaPods 1.1+ is required to build SFaceCompare.

To install library, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '11.3'
use_frameworks!

target '<Your Target Name>' do
    pod 'SFaceCompare'
end
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```
## Usage Example
Faces are the same           |  Faces are different

##### AppDelegate.swift
In Your App delegate call SFaceCompare.opncvwrp.loadData() to load model related data. This Operation is long and async. So better put this before using methods from pod.
```swift
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
    SFaceCompare.prepareData()
    return true
}
```
As simple as possible
```swift
// 1: Create compare object
let faceComparator = SFaceCompare(on: image1, and: image2)
// 2: Call compareFaces method with success and error handlers
faceComparator.compareFaces(success: { results in }, failure: {  error in })
```
